Setting: 
You are a middle-aged salaryman who was abducted and forced to complete an American Ninja Warrior track before The American Ninja Warrior catches you. 



NOTES: 

The placement of obstacles in the sketches is relative to the other objects. Actual distances should be adjusted according to the player's movement capabilities.

This should be at night, and preferably the course would be lit by spotlights from above. Extra light on each platform would be nice.

Maybe consider placing bloodstains on any obstacles people find difficult (in order to represent previous victims of The American Ninja Warrior)
